# mosdex-python

A Python demonstration of the MOSDEX standard for large-scale modular optimization problems.  It is based on an experimental version of the MOSDEX Schema (version 1.3-ajk), which is still being refined.  The MOSDEX standard is documented in the repository https://github.com/coin-modeling-dev/MOSDEX-Examples.

The schema is included in the `data` directory, along with a `sailco` file that tests it.
* To install the mosdex-python package and dependencies: `pip install .`
* The notebook [samples/sailco.ipynb](samples/sailco.ipynb) is an example that generates data suitable for a solver.
* The file [samples/sailco-notebook-documentation.pdf](samples/sailco-notebook-documentation.pdf) documents the notebook (generated by Perplexity.ai) 


Wish list:
* Syntax to describe functional relationships between independent and dependent variables
* Syntax to describe sequence operators: `next` and `previous`
* Interfaces to some modeling languages
* Interfaces to COIN-OR/OSI libraries for integer, nonlinear, and stochastic dynamic optimization
* Implementations of decomposition algorithms
* Implementation of decomposition using distributed Cloud services
